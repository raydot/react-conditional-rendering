# react-conditional-rendering
Following Robin Wieruch's tutorial on Conditional Rendering in React.  https://www.robinwieruch.de/conditional-rendering-react/

From the introduction:
"A conditional render in React is no witchcraft.  In JSX...you can use pure JavaScript.  In Javascript you should be familiar with if-else or switch case statements...

"But what is conditional rendering in React?  In a condition render a component decides in one or several conditions which elements it will return. ...When a component has conditional rendering, the instance of the rendered component can have different looks."
